 PlexFix
=========

This project is based upon a scrip that can be found (here)[http://axisdata.com/FixPlexPosters] which itself was a response to steps outlines by Nik Ansell which can be found (here)[https://nikansell.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/fixing-corrupt-plex-thumbnails/]



Project Setup
=============

This is my first published script and as such it is very simple in setup and use. As time progresses I will add features and setup steps.
There is still a need to manually refresh the database of the TV show/Movie which was corrupted, this should be changed when I add in the Plex API functionality.
